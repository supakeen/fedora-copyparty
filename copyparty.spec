# Note that `copyparty` vendors Python, Javascript, CSS, and font files in
# its upstream releases. Together with upstream we've been able to de-vendor
# the Python dependencies but the Javascript and CSS is difficult to undo.
# These files are either not packaged in Fedora, or are patched upstream [1].

# This package skips trying to de-vendor these assets under the 'hardship' part
# of the Javascript packaging policy [2] or the similar clause under the CSS
# packaging guidelines [3].
#
# > Packages containing JavaScript should make the best effort to regenerate
# > any precompiled/minimized JS wherever possible, as this leads to more
# > maintainable packages. Where this would result in a significant hardship,
# > the bundled pregenerated JS may be shipped with a specfile comment
# > explaining the decision. This does not eliminate the requirement to
# > validate licenses of bundled code.
#
# Licenses for the vendored javascript have been separately verified and are
# included in the `License` field.
